# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Neural Networks

A Python and Jupyter Notebook project that demonstrates how to train a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset from Kaggle. This repository includes code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and serves as a guide for those interested in machine learning and computer vision. Dive into the notebook to learn and experiment with digit recognition!
